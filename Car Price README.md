The dataset available at Car Price Dataset - Kaggle
Purpose of the Project
The major aim of this project is to gain insight into the sales data of cars and the different features that influence their car prices
About Data
The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle  Car Price Dataset - Kaggle and contains 10,000 entries, each representing information about a car and its price


Feature Engineering:
create new features that might better capture the underlying patterns, such as:
•	Car Age (age_of_car) – Derived from the car’s manufacturing year.
•	Mileage per Year (mileage_per_year) – Calculated as total mileage divided by the car’s age.
•	Price per Horsepower (price_per_hp) – A ratio to measure value in terms of performance.
•	Model Popularity (model_popularity) – Counts the number of listings per car model to identify demand trends.
